Explanation of the Example:
Initialization:

The dac.begin() function initializes I2C communication.
The DAC is then ready to receive commands.
Setting DAC Output:

The dac.setDAC() function is used to set the output voltage on specific DAC channels. For example, dac.setDAC(DAC_ADDRESS, CH_A, WriteUpdate, 32768) sets DAC_A to a value of 32768 (which is roughly half of the maximum value 65536).
Similarly, DAC_B and DAC_C are set to values 16384 and 49152, respectively.
Reading DAC Values:

The dac.readDAC() function reads the DAC values from the specified channels. In this example, it reads the values of DAC_A and DAC_B into the readValues array and prints the values to the serial monitor.
Setting Power State:

The dac.setPowerState() function is used to set the power-down state of the DACs. For example, DAC_A is set to 100kÎ© mode (low power state), while DAC_B remains active.
Reset:

The dac.reset() function resets the DAC to its power-on state.
Notes:
DAC Address: In the example, the DAC address is set to 0x08 (DAC_A), but you can change this to 0x09, 0x0A, or 0x0B depending on which DAC you are using (based on the configuration of pins A1 and A0).
Serial Monitor: The serial monitor is used to display the status of the DAC settings (such as when channels are set to specific values or powered down).
Channel Flags:
CH_A, CH_B, CH_C, CH_D refer to the DAC channels. You can combine these flags with the bitwise OR (|) operator to control multiple channels at once. For example, CH_A | CH_B would select both channels A and B.
